n't much could say praise already truly believe fullmetal alchemist : brotherhood deserves every bit pacing phenomenal ; filler minimal nonexistent every episode serve another step forward know people think first episode explanatory enough one great thing lack unnecessarily long narrative ; give enough background information without petulantly walk fmab also one anime prefer dubbed version subbed voice ... actor fit fantastically role opening ending part great animation gorgeous well especially action shot think important thing take account plot character center fmab two brother enough flaw emotionally connect many cross boundary overly annoy length ( 64 episode ) allow steady character development whether good bad even villain sort depth without make seem like rushed pity backstory sometimes crass humor ( serve surprisingly well comic relief ) also harshly realistic ; good people die n't always good reason go watch ! hope 'll love much

bem de acordo com gin-san : `` nem nós sabemos para mim gintama é um grande filler com alguns arcos de anime enfiados meio de formas geniais gintama conta uma história sobre japão em um momento em que ele foi dominado por forças alienígenas trama tem como foco nossas quatro protagonistas : gintoki shinpachi kagura e sadaharu agora falando anime gintama é de fato muito bom todos personagens tem um carisma diferente desde suas personalidades até suas crenças como nosso revolucionário zura oh erro meu `` zura janai katsura da `` querido hasegawa-san ( madao ) toda shinsegumi desde kondo-san ( gorila ) hijikata-san ( maionese ) okita-kun ( sadista ) entre outros sério tem muuuuuuitos personagens que acaba sendo um problema também poi é impossível mostrar todos eles sempre então tem alguns momentos em que eles simplesmente desaparecem por vários episódios e ainda assim continuam aparecer mais personagens tem alguns momentos em que isso se torna enjoativo universo de gintama é sem dúvida incrível com advento dos alienígenas fica fácil colocar várias situações diferentes que vão desde comédia ( como toda cenas em que baka digo hata ouji aparece ) até drama ( como preconceito que existe entre amantos e os humanos ) isso sim é algo forte em gintama é um shounen que tem comédia como essência sabe criar várias situações pesadas e tristes um exemplo disso são side story vilões tem algumas que de fato fizeram lacrimejar além de todos es pontos músicas soundtrack são maravilhosas ela encaixam muito bem com cenas e quantidade que eles usam é incrível ( se tiver um tempo procura algum playlist pra ouvir algumas ) e são impressionantes como histórias se encaixam sem dúvidas os personagens são coisas mais cativantes das obras você pode acabar não gostando de um ou outro é impossível de não gostar de pelo menos um deles até tais “ vilões ” tem suas histórias muito bem desenvolvidas que te faz gostar ainda mais de gintama criar um afeto especial por esse grande “ vazio de anime ” e cheio de sentimentos nem todos episódios vão te fazer rir ou te fazer chorar alguns deles vai te tocar tenho certeza e não subestime gintama por ele querer levar tudo na comédia é jeito autor mostrar que você deve rir até em momentos que parecem impossíveis falando gorila ( não kondo ) eu acho impressionante como ele consegue mexer com quem assiste sua obra é inegável clara melhora da adaptação estúdio e diretor conseguiram dar um ar único com toda aquelas quebras da 4° parede talvez único ‘ ‘ problema ’ ’ em gintama para nós ( ocidente ) sejam várias referências cultura de lá como na estrutura de sua língua ou atores comediantes e os próprios sennyu ( dubladores ) que faz alguns episódios serem extremamente “ chatos ” menos que você realmente entenda também acho que nem todas idades conseguem apreciar de fato gintama lembro que comecei assistir quando tinha 10~11 anos e achei extremamente poi era um shounen sem aquelas coisas de gritar poderes ou um protagonista que fosse de fato “ badass ” hoje com meus 19 ano consigo aproveitar muito mais eu não quero estender falando disso então deem uma chance gintama é um anime incrível que tem muito que te mostrar tanto em história quanto em comédia e claro em personagens

( review apply entire gintama series ) gintama ? well accord gin-san : `` n't even know gintama great filler anime bow tuck middle genius shape gintama tell story japan time dominate alien force plot focus four protagonist : gintoki shinpachi kagura sadaharu speak anime gintama good indeed character different charisma personality belief like revolutionary zura oh mistake `` zura janai katsura da `` dear hasegawa-san ( madao ) whole shinsegumi ... kondo-san ( gorilla ) hijikata-san ( mayonnaise ) okita-kun ( sadist ) among others seriously soooo many character turn problem 's impossible always show time disappear several episode yet character still appear moment happen make nauseating gintama 's universe undoubtedly incredible advent alien easy put many different situation range comedy ( like scene baka say hata ouji appear ) dramas ( like prejudice exist amantos human ) something strong gintama shounen comedy essence know create various heavy sad situation example side story villain fact make water apart point song soundtrack wonderful fit scene well amount use amazing ( time look playlist hear ) 's amazing story fit together undoubtedly character captivating thing work may end like one impossible like least one even `` villain story well develop make even fond gintama create special affection great `` void anime full feeling episode make laugh make cry touch 'm sure n't underestimate gintama want take everything comedy 's author 's way show laugh even time seem impossible speaking gorilla ( kondo ) find impressive mess watch work undeniable clear improvement adaptation studio director manage give unique air 4th wall break perhaps 'problem ' gintama u ( west ) various reference culture structure language actor comedian sennyu ( voice actor ) make episode extremely bore unless really understand also think age really appreciate gintama remember start watch 10 ~ 11 find extremely shounen without scream power stuff protagonist really “ badass ” today 19 year enjoy much n't want talk give gintama try 's amazing anime lot show history comedy course character ( essa review vale para toda série gintama ) ( pt-br ) que se trata gintama ? bem de acordo com gin-san : `` nem nós sabemos para mim gintama é um grande filler com alguns arcos de anime enfiados meio de formas geniais gintama conta uma história sobre japão em um momento em que ele foi dominado por forças alienígenas trama tem como foco nossas quatro protagonistas : gintoki shinpachi kagura e sadaharu agora falando anime gintama é de fato muito bom todos personagens tem um carisma diferente desde suas personalidades até suas crenças como nosso revolucionário zura oh erro meu `` zura janai katsura da `` querido hasegawa-san ( madao ) toda shinsegumi desde kondo-san ( gorila ) hijikata-san ( maionese ) okita-kun ( sadista ) entre outros sério tem muuuuuuitos personagens que acaba sendo um problema também poi é impossível mostrar todos eles sempre então tem alguns momentos em que eles simplesmente desaparecem por vários episódios e ainda assim continuam aparecer mais personagens tem alguns momentos em que isso se torna enjoativo universo de gintama é sem dúvida incrível com advento dos alienígenas fica fácil colocar várias situações diferentes que vão desde comédia ( como toda cenas em que baka digo hata ouji aparece ) até drama ( como preconceito que existe entre amantos e os humanos ) isso sim é algo forte em gintama é um shounen que tem comédia como essência sabe criar várias situações pesadas e tristes um exemplo disso são side story vilões tem algumas que de fato fizeram lacrimejar além de todos es pontos músicas soundtrack são maravilhosas ela encaixam muito bem com cenas e quantidade que eles usam é incrível ( se tiver um tempo procura algum playlist pra ouvir algumas ) e são impressionantes como histórias se encaixam sem dúvidas os personagens são coisas mais cativantes das obras você pode acabar não gostando de um ou outro é impossível de não gostar de pelo menos um deles até tais “ vilões ” tem suas histórias muito bem desenvolvidas que te faz gostar ainda mais de gintama criar um afeto especial por esse grande “ vazio de anime ” e cheio de sentimentos nem todos episódios vão te fazer rir ou te fazer chorar alguns deles vai te tocar tenho certeza e não subestime gintama por ele querer levar tudo na comédia é jeito autor mostrar que você deve rir até em momentos que parecem impossíveis falando gorila ( não kondo ) eu acho impressionante como ele consegue mexer com quem assiste sua obra é inegável clara melhora da adaptação estúdio e diretor conseguiram dar um ar único com toda aquelas quebras da 4° parede talvez único ‘ ‘ problema ’ ’ em gintama para nós ( ocidente ) sejam várias referências cultura de lá como na estrutura de sua língua ou atores comediantes e os próprios sennyu ( dubladores ) que faz alguns episódios serem extremamente “ chatos ” menos que você realmente entenda também acho que nem todas idades conseguem apreciar de fato gintama lembro que comecei assistir quando tinha 10~11 anos e achei extremamente poi era um shounen sem aquelas coisas de gritar poderes ou um protagonista que fosse de fato “ badass ” hoje com meus 19 ano consigo aproveitar muito mais eu não quero estender falando disso então deem uma chance gintama é um anime incrível que tem muito que te mostrar tanto em história quanto em comédia e claro em personagens

bem de acordo com gin-san : `` nem nós sabemos para mim gintama é um grande filler com alguns arcos de anime enfiados meio de formas geniais gintama conta uma história sobre japão em um momento em que ele foi dominado por forças alienígenas trama tem como foco nossas quatro protagonistas : gintoki shinpachi kagura e sadaharu agora falando anime gintama é de fato muito bom todos personagens tem um carisma diferente desde suas personalidades até suas crenças como nosso revolucionário zura oh erro meu `` zura janai katsura da `` querido hasegawa-san ( madao ) toda shinsegumi desde kondo-san ( gorila ) hijikata-san ( maionese ) okita-kun ( sadista ) entre outros sério tem muuuuuuitos personagens que acaba sendo um problema também poi é impossível mostrar todos eles sempre então tem alguns momentos em que eles simplesmente desaparecem por vários episódios e ainda assim continuam aparecer mais personagens tem alguns momentos em que isso se torna enjoativo universo de gintama é sem dúvida incrível com advento dos alienígenas fica fácil colocar várias situações diferentes que vão desde comédia ( como toda cenas em que baka digo hata ouji aparece ) até drama ( como preconceito que existe entre amantos e os humanos ) isso sim é algo forte em gintama é um shounen que tem comédia como essência sabe criar várias situações pesadas e tristes um exemplo disso são side story vilões tem algumas que de fato fizeram lacrimejar além de todos es pontos músicas soundtrack são maravilhosas ela encaixam muito bem com cenas e quantidade que eles usam é incrível ( se tiver um tempo procura algum playlist pra ouvir algumas ) e são impressionantes como histórias se encaixam sem dúvidas os personagens são coisas mais cativantes das obras você pode acabar não gostando de um ou outro é impossível de não gostar de pelo menos um deles até tais “ vilões ” tem suas histórias muito bem desenvolvidas que te faz gostar ainda mais de gintama criar um afeto especial por esse grande “ vazio de anime ” e cheio de sentimentos nem todos episódios vão te fazer rir ou te fazer chorar alguns deles vai te tocar tenho certeza e não subestime gintama por ele querer levar tudo na comédia é jeito autor mostrar que você deve rir até em momentos que parecem impossíveis falando gorila ( não kondo ) eu acho impressionante como ele consegue mexer com quem assiste sua obra é inegável clara melhora da adaptação estúdio e diretor conseguiram dar um ar único com toda aquelas quebras da 4° parede talvez único ‘ ‘ problema ’ ’ em gintama para nós ( ocidente ) sejam várias referências cultura de lá como na estrutura de sua língua ou atores comediantes e os próprios sennyu ( dubladores ) que faz alguns episódios serem extremamente “ chatos ” menos que você realmente entenda também acho que nem todas idades conseguem apreciar de fato gintama lembro que comecei assistir quando tinha 10~11 anos e achei extremamente poi era um shounen sem aquelas coisas de gritar poderes ou um protagonista que fosse de fato “ badass ” hoje com meus 19 ano consigo aproveitar muito mais eu não quero estender falando disso então deem uma chance gintama é um anime incrível que tem muito que te mostrar tanto em história quanto em comédia e claro em personagens esse final é algo completamente plausivel com gintama sem dúvidas algo que só gintama faz nada sério anime termina da mesma forma que começou : `` nada é justamente disso que se trata gintama

bem de acordo com gin-san : `` nem nós sabemos para mim gintama é um grande filler com alguns arcos de anime enfiados meio de formas geniais gintama conta uma história sobre japão em um momento em que ele foi dominado por forças alienígenas trama tem como foco nossas quatro protagonistas : gintoki shinpachi kagura e sadaharu agora falando anime gintama é de fato muito bom todos personagens tem um carisma diferente desde suas personalidades até suas crenças como nosso revolucionário zura oh erro meu `` zura janai katsura da `` querido hasegawa-san ( madao ) toda shinsegumi desde kondo-san ( gorila ) hijikata-san ( maionese ) okita-kun ( sadista ) entre outros sério tem muuuuuuitos personagens que acaba sendo um problema também poi é impossível mostrar todos eles sempre então tem alguns momentos em que eles simplesmente desaparecem por vários episódios e ainda assim continuam aparecer mais personagens tem alguns momentos em que isso se torna enjoativo universo de gintama é sem dúvida incrível com advento dos alienígenas fica fácil colocar várias situações diferentes que vão desde comédia ( como toda cenas em que baka digo hata ouji aparece ) até drama ( como preconceito que existe entre amantos e os humanos ) isso sim é algo forte em gintama é um shounen que tem comédia como essência sabe criar várias situações pesadas e tristes um exemplo disso são side story vilões tem algumas que de fato fizeram lacrimejar além de todos es pontos músicas soundtrack são maravilhosas ela encaixam muito bem com cenas e quantidade que eles usam é incrível ( se tiver um tempo procura algum playlist pra ouvir algumas ) e são impressionantes como histórias se encaixam sem dúvidas os personagens são coisas mais cativantes das obras você pode acabar não gostando de um ou outro é impossível de não gostar de pelo menos um deles até tais “ vilões ” tem suas histórias muito bem desenvolvidas que te faz gostar ainda mais de gintama criar um afeto especial por esse grande “ vazio de anime ” e cheio de sentimentos nem todos episódios vão te fazer rir ou te fazer chorar alguns deles vai te tocar tenho certeza e não subestime gintama por ele querer levar tudo na comédia é jeito autor mostrar que você deve rir até em momentos que parecem impossíveis falando gorila ( não kondo ) eu acho impressionante como ele consegue mexer com quem assiste sua obra é inegável clara melhora da adaptação estúdio e diretor conseguiram dar um ar único com toda aquelas quebras da 4° parede talvez único ‘ ‘ problema ’ ’ em gintama para nós ( ocidente ) sejam várias referências cultura de lá como na estrutura de sua língua ou atores comediantes e os próprios sennyu ( dubladores ) que faz alguns episódios serem extremamente “ chatos ” menos que você realmente entenda também acho que nem todas idades conseguem apreciar de fato gintama lembro que comecei assistir quando tinha 10~11 anos e achei extremamente poi era um shounen sem aquelas coisas de gritar poderes ou um protagonista que fosse de fato “ badass ” hoje com meus 19 ano consigo aproveitar muito mais eu não quero estender falando disso então deem uma chance gintama é um anime incrível que tem muito que te mostrar tanto em história quanto em comédia e claro em personagens

ton ton easily accessible information every single one start player 're face since age ago thus appropriately prepared come well ahead time especially consider shounen series pretty much every player super specific skillset like ushijima 's raw power spike tendou 's `` guess monster gimmick rather all-round solid player like generally expect high-level player real life word come hard counter much easy reality long know deal ahead time karasuno really know like sort understand opposite scenario shiratorizawa may confident enough victory really care research opponent similarly karasuno 's match early round tournament less opposition guess excuse might somewhat apply final much like take college exam without study hop raw talent enough figure answer spot sure maybe work still seem hell lot smarter study ahead time instead logic applies karasuno tournament final speaking skillsets also say aforementioned ability particular pretty ridiculous professional volleyball player base move around try read opponent ' eye movement similar like tendou ?
