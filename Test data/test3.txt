It\'s not a shōnen manga, it\'s a shōjo manga.Everything feels familiar and cliché in terms of the setting.Zenitsu\'s character design and way of speaking are creepy.The humor? It\'s not funny. It\'s boring and creepy.That voice actor, Hanamori, or whatever his name is, made me feel sick the moment I heard it.I endured it, thinking it would eventually become interesting, but what\'s so entertaining about it? The female characters are all ugly except for the pink-haired one. Well, I guess girls love looking down on ugly people, right? And the only cute one with pink hair doesn\'t even have any significant moments.The author says, "Annoying cute girl characters are side characters! Side characters!"By making the heroine his little sister, they eliminate the love element that would be a nuisance to female readers. Is it to facilitate perverted fantasies?On top of that, she hardly speaks because she always has a bamboo in her mouth. What\'s the appeal there? Is she like a statue or something?Anyway, they added her reluctantly because they didn\'t want it to be recognized as a perverted manga. In the end, she\'s mostly confined to a box. As a result, the screen is filled with guys.It\'s a common trope with female authors.The content is just a "prettier version of Momotaro." I mean, come on, watching this and thinking it has "substance" or "thought-provoking elements" is just laughable. I wonder what would happen if they entered society, haha. I could come up with a scenario like this myself. The artwork is amazing, but I\'ll set it to a 1 because I get irritated by all the stuff on Twitter and YouTube that comes into view. Apparently, it\'s popular among women, but even as an adult man, it\'s not enjoyable at all. I want my wasted time back. If you can enjoy Momotaro, go ahead, but I\'m too low-level for it, it\'s impossible.
