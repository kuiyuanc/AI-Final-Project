This is the current "Shonen Jump."When it comes to Shonen Jump, it is a manga magazine that represents the traditional Japan with the three words "effort, friendship, and victory." It should be a classic manga magazine with the same level of fame and popularity as DC and Marvel in the world of American comics. However...Since "Death Note" and "Attack on Titan," the dark and cynical trend has become extremely popular, and this work is no exception, completely denying the essence of what Shonen Jump originally stood for. (Although, "effort, friendship, and victory" are portrayed within the work to some extent.)The reason for this shift is that the readership has grown older, and the current state of society reflects the difficulty in accepting effort, friendship, and victory sincerely.Whether it is good or bad, Marvel and DC have established their corporate structures and emphasized the traditional and universal sense of Western justice, with superhero movies like "The Avengers" and "Justice League" reigning at the top of the film industry. However, Japan is in this sorry state.In essence, Japan lacks concepts of morality, ethics, and purity in today\'s society, and has a very shallow sense of human relationships, social ethics, and moral values.Well, there\'s nothing to be done. If this is what the current Jump works are like, who knows what will happen to others.I have watched all the episodes: I think it\'s well put together, for better or worse, but I would like to see a bit more anime-like movement. Since it focuses on the story, the action tends to be a bit lacking, but I believe they could put in a bit more effort. That\'s just my opinion.
